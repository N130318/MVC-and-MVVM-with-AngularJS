There are numerous **design patterns** such as **MVC**, **MVVM**, **DI** etc. It depends upon the problem that which **design pattern** needs to be followed.\r\n\r\nThis blog emphasizes on **MVC** and **MVVM** **design patterns** with reference to **AngularJS**.\r\n\r\nLet's get started:\r\n\r\n**MVC Design Pattern**\r\n\r\nTo start with, **MVC design pattern** is not specific to **AngularJS**, you must have seen/implemented this pattern in many other **programming languages**.\r\n\r\n**MVC design pattern** can be seen in **AngularJS**, but before getting into that let's see what all does **MVC design pattern** includes:\r\n\r\n1. Model: **Model** is nothing but data.\r\n2. View: **View** represents this data.\r\n3. Controller: **Controller** mediates between the two.\r\n\r\nLet's see the code below:\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html ng-app>\r\n<head>\r\n    <title>MVC</title>\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"angular.min.js\"></script>\r\n</head>\r\n<body ng-controller=\"TextController\">\r\n<p>{{sampleText}}</p>\r\n</body>\r\n<script>\r\n    function TextController($scope) {\r\n        $scope.sampleText = 'This is a demo!';\r\n    }\r\n</script>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above snippet, our text is represented by \"sampleText\" variable. This is our **model**. **Controller** is updating the **view** by displaying the data on the **view** by replacing \"{{sampleText}}\" with sampleText variable value. It is the **controller** that is managing the relationship between our **model** and the **view** which is the **HTML**.\r\n\r\nIn **MVC** if we make any change in the the **view** it doesn't gets updated in **model**. But in **AngularJS**, we have heard that there is something called **2-way binding** and this **2-way binding** enables **MVVM design pattern**. **MVVM** basically includes 3 things:\r\n\r\n1. Model\r\n2. View\r\n3. View Model\r\n\r\n**Controller** is actually replaced by **View Model** in **MMVM design pattern**. **View Model** is nothing but a **JavaScript** **function** which is again like a **controller** and is responsible for maintaining relationship between **view** and **model**, but the difference here is, if we update anything in **view**, it gets updated in **model**, change anything in **model**, it shows up in **view**, which is what we call **2-way binding**.\r\n\r\nLet's see the example given below:\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html ng-app>\r\n<head>\r\n    <title>Number Divisor</title>\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"angular.min.js\"></script>\r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\n<form ng-controller=\"DivisionController\">\r\n    <label>Number :</label> <input name=\"number\" ng-change=\"divisionNeeded()\" ng-model=\"data.number\">\r\n    <label>Number entered by User :</label> {{data.number}} <br>\r\n    <label>Divisor :</label> <input name=\"divisor\" ng-change=\"divisionNeeded()\" ng-model=\"data.divisor\">\r\n    <label>Number entered by User :</label> {{data.divisor}} <br>\r\n    <label>Result :</label> {{data.result}}\r\n</form>\r\n</body>\r\n<script>\r\n    function DivisionController($scope) {\r\n        $scope.data = {number: 0, divisor: 0, result: 0};\r\n        $scope.divisionNeeded = function () {\r\n            $scope.data.result = $scope.data.number / $scope.data.divisor;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n</script>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above code contains 2 input boxes which takes number and a divisor to divide that number. The result of the division is shown in front of the label 'Result'.\r\n\r\nAlso, whatever is input in those two input boxes is displayed in front of the input box itself. This code shows the **MVVM design pattern** in **JavaScript** very clearly, here you see how:\r\n\r\n![MVVM.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NamitaMalik/MVC-and-MVVM-with-AngularJS/master/MVVM.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe above diagram segregates the code into **Model**, **View** and **View Model**.\r\n\r\nI am first starting with **view**. We know that **view** is our **HTML**,so we update it by entering '6' in the number text box and '3' in the divisor text box. As soon as any change is made in the **view**, **View Model** gets to know about it, and these values are then updated into the **Model**. Apart from this, the main work is that is happening in **View Model** is the division, number is getting divided by the divisor and is the result is being assigned to 'data.result' variable. Here, since 'data.result' is our model, and as there is change here from it's initial value of '0' to '2' now, view gets updated and the result of the division is shown on the **HTML**.\r\n\r\nThis is why we say **AngularJS** follows **MVVM design pattern**.\r\n\r\nFollow Me\r\n---\r\n[Github](https://github.com/NamitaMalik)\r\n\r\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/namita13_04)\r\n\r\n[LinkedIn](https://in.linkedin.com/in/namita-malik-a7885b23)\r\n\r\n[More Blogs By Me](https://namitamalik.github.io/)",
